# Gatekeeper
Gatekeeper is the evolution of Disboot.

## Description of Gatekeeper
Gatekeeper will allow server owners to easily ban users from entering.
They can use the /export command to generate a code to share with others which will use /import < code > to import the same bans.
This will ultimately allow ban categories than can instantly be added to any server incase you want to stop a specific group of people from joining your community.

## What I Want
- The bot should handle multiple servers with their own configs and bans.
- To make a /export command
- To make a /import command
- To make a /ban command

## Command List
- `` /export `` - Exports the bans into a importable code for sharing
- `` /import <code> `` - Import a ban list that was made from a export command
- `` /ban <user> <reason> `` - Bans a user and adds them to your servers ban list
