# Gatekeeper

**Gatekeeper** is the evolution of Disboot — a Discord bot designed to make **ban management across multiple servers simple and collaborative**.

---

## ✨ What is Gatekeeper?
Gatekeeper allows server owners to efficiently **ban problematic users** and **share/import ban lists** with other communities. This creates a shared defense system where server owners can **exchange ban categories** to prevent specific groups or malicious users from accessing their servers.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- Manage bans across **multiple servers**, each with their own configurations.
- Easily **export ban lists** to share with trusted communities.
- **Import shared ban lists** to instantly block groups of harmful users.
- Maintain a **centralized banlist per server**, making moderation faster and more consistent.
